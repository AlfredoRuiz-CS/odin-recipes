# odin-recipes
Basic HTML Recipe Website which serves as the first project in the Odin Project.  
I created a recipe website with multiple HTML pages for other recipes leveraging key or foundational HTML concepts.  
I implemented my knowledge of HTML boilerplate, headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, and important HTML tags. 
Project will be improved and furthered with as I progress in my learning.
